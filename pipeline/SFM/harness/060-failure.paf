# This policy configures the stage that appears as the failure stage of

# This is the event topic we will send our event indicating that this 
# pipeline has finished its attempt on the assigned job.  This needs to 
# match "listen.pipelineEvent" in the policy for the JobOffice that 
# manages this pipeline.  
#
pipelineEvent:  TBD: SfmJob

# This must be set to False for a failure stage to indicate that this 
# pipeline failed to finish its job.
#
jobSuccess: false

# This job-done stage will also send out data-ready event when this
# policy file contains one or more "datasets" items.  This failure policy
# file should include "datasets" entries matching the job-done stage and
# any other data-ready stages.
