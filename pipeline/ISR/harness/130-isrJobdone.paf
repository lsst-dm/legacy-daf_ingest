#<?cfg paf policy ?>

########################################################################
# This policy configures the stage that appears at the end of the 
# pipeline that receives a job assignment from the job office.
#
# The dictionary data defines this policy is policies/JobDone_dict.paf.
########################################################################
 
# This is the event topic we will send our event indicating that this 
# pipeline has finished its assigned job.  This needs to match 
# listen.pipelineEvent in the policy for the JobOffice that manages 
# this pipeline.  
#
pipelineEvent:  IsrJob

# jobSuccess: true    # (Note: set this to false in failure.paf)

# This job-done stage will also send out data-ready event when this
# policy file contains one or more "datasets" items. 
# 
datasets: {

   # this is the event topic that will be used to send data-ready events
   # for the datasets covered by this "datasets" entry.  It must match 
   # the "listen.dataReadyEvent" parameter in policies for all JobOffice 
   # that are interested in these datasets.
   # 
   dataReadyEvent:  CcdAssemblyJob

   # this item restricts data-ready events going out on the above topic
   # to datasets of the given type.  If this parameter is not set, events
   # will go out for all possible datasets; this is what we want in this 
   # example pipeline.
   #
   datasetType:  PostISR
}

inputKeys: {

    # this key will hold the list of datasets stage that were successfully
    # persisted.  It should have been updated by the output stages.  Any 
    # datasets that are in the "possibleDatasets" list that are not in this 
    # one will be marked invalid, telling the JobOffice that the pipeline 
    # failed to produce them.  Thus, this value must match the corresponding 
    # keys in the output stages and the get-a-job stage.  
    # 
    # completedDatasets: outputDatasets

 # TBD

    # this is a python list of all the possible output datasets produced
    # by this pipeline that will be needed by other pipelines.  If there 
    # are "datasets" items specified above, this list will be used to 
    # send out the data-ready events.  This value must match the 
    # corresponding keys used in any data-ready stages and in the 
    # get-a-job stage.  
    # 
    # possibleDatasets:  targetDatasets

 # TBD
